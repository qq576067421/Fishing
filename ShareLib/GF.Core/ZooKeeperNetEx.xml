             This is the main class of ZooKeeper client library. To use a ZooKeeper
             service, an application must first instantiate an object of ZooKeeper class.
             All the iterations will be done by calling the methods of ZooKeeper class.
             The methods of this class are thread-safe unless otherwise noted.
             </summary>
             <remarks>
             Once a connection to a server is established, a session ID is assigned to the
             client. The client will send heart beats to the server periodically to keep
             the session valid.
             
             The application can call ZooKeeper APIs through a client as long as the
             session ID of the client remains valid.
             
             If for some reason, the client fails to send heart beats to the server for a
             prolonged period of time (exceeding the sessionTimeout value, for instance),
             the server will expire the session, and the session ID will become invalid.
             The client object will no longer be usable. To make ZooKeeper API calls, the
             application must create a new client object.
             
             If the ZooKeeper server the client currently connects to fails or otherwise
             does not respond, the client will automatically try to connect to another
             server before its session ID expires. If successful, the application can
             continue to use the client.
             
             The ZooKeeper API methods are either synchronous or asynchronous. Synchronous
             methods blocks until the server has responded. Asynchronous methods just queue
             the request for sending and return immediately. They take a callback object that
             will be executed either on successful execution of the request or on error with
             an appropriate return code (rc) indicating the error.
             
             Some successful ZooKeeper API calls can leave watches on the "data nodes" in
             the ZooKeeper server. Other successful ZooKeeper API calls can trigger those
             watches. Once a watch is triggered, an event will be delivered to the client
             which left the watch at the first place. Each watch can be triggered only
             once. Thus, up to one event will be delivered to a client for every watch it
             leaves.
             
             A client needs an object of a class implementing Watcher interface for
             processing the events delivered to the client.
            
             When a client drops current connection and re-connects to a server, all the
             existing watches are considered as being triggered but the undelivered events
             are lost. To emulate this, the client will generate a special event to tell
             the event handler a connection has been dropped. This special event has type
             EventNone and state sKeeperStateDisconnected

            To create a ZooKeeper client object, the application needs to pass a connection string containing a comma separated list 
            of host:port pairs, each corresponding to a ZooKeeper server.
            Session establishment is asynchronous. This constructor will initiate connection to the server and return immediately - 
            potentially (usually) before the session is fully established. The watcher argument specifies the watcher that will be 
            notified of any changes in state. This notification can come at any point before or after the constructor call has returned.
            The instantiated ZooKeeper client object will pick an arbitrary server from the connectstring and attempt to connect to it.
            If establishment of the connection fails, another server in the connect string will be tried (the order is non-deterministic, as we random shuffle the list)
            , until a connection is established. The client will continue attempts until the session is explicitly closed 
            (or the session is expired by the server).
            Added in 3.2.0: An optional "chroot" suffix may also be appended to the connection string. This will run the client 
            commands while interpreting all paths relative to this root (similar to the unix chroot command).

            be relative to this root - ie getting/setting/etc... "/foo/bar" would result in operations being run on "/app/a/foo/bar"

            <summary>
            To create a ZooKeeper client object, the application needs to pass a connection string containing a comma separated list 
            of host:port pairs, each corresponding to a ZooKeeper server.
            Session establishment is asynchronous. This constructor will initiate connection to the server and return immediately - 
            potentially (usually) before the session is fully established. The watcher argument specifies the watcher that will be 
            notified of any changes in state. This notification can come at any point before or after the constructor call has returned.
            The instantiated ZooKeeper client object will pick an arbitrary server from the connectstring and attempt to connect to it.
            If establishment of the connection fails, another server in the connect string will be tried (the order is non-deterministic, as we random shuffle the list)
            , until a connection is established. The client will continue attempts until the session is explicitly closed 
            (or the session is expired by the server).
            Added in 3.2.0: An optional "chroot" suffix may also be appended to the connection string. This will run the client 
            commands while interpreting all paths relative to this root (similar to the unix chroot command).
            Use <see cref="M:org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.getSessionId"/> and <see cref="M:org.apache.zookeeper.ZooKeeper.getSessionPasswd"/> on an established client connection, these values must be 
            passed as sessionId and sessionPasswd respectively if reconnecting. Otherwise, if not reconnecting, use the other 
            constructor which does not require these parameters.

            "127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:3001,127.0.0.1:3002/app/a" where the client would be rooted at "/app/a" and all paths would 
            be relative to this root - ie getting/setting/etc... "/foo/bar" would result in operations being run on "/app/a/foo/bar"

            The method "Dns.GetHostAddressesAsync" doesn't exist in .NET 4
            But, it isn't really async in .NET 4.5 and up. The internal implementation
            just queues a blocking call on the thread pool. see: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11480742/dns-begingethost-methods-blocking
            Therefore, the .NET 4 implementation here is equivalent to "Dns.GetHostAddressesAsync".
            In .NET Core the implementation is OS specific, so real async implementations
            might exist.
